# AsyncStorage Initialization Issue in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native: attempting to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized. The project includes example code showing the problematic behavior and a solution to prevent it.

## Problem

Accessing AsyncStorage too early (e.g., in `componentDidMount` before the app is completely ready) can cause unpredictable issues.  These might manifest as silent failures where data doesn't get saved or retrieved, or more serious crashes.

## Solution

The recommended solution is to use a state variable to track AsyncStorage's readiness and only perform actions once the initialization is confirmed.  This ensures that all operations are performed after the AsyncStorage is properly set up.
